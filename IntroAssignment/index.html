    <h2><strong>It's Me I Guess</strong></h2>
<!-- I don't know what to comment honestly -->
    <p>
      I'm a newly born software developer just trying my best to get by. I am currently located in Santa Fe, NM!
    </p>
    <p>
      As someone that sits on their computer 24/7 I am someone that's interested in:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Gaming - One day I hope to code my own game </li>
      <li> Reading - Hopefully this translates into being proficient in code literacy </li>
      <li> Animals - Keeping my fingers crossed that my cats don't cause me to lose my sanity before I finish this coding course </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- comedic relief -->
    <p>
      This is a question many of you may be asking yourselves right now. Who is Andrew Barr? Turns out, he's just a guy. 
    </p>
    <p>
      On a more serious note, I'm just a beginner software developer trying to find my place in this field. I'm hoping to have a better grasp on the fundamentels in the near future so that I can pursue more ambitious projects beyond a simple web page in the near future!
